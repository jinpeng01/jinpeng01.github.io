About me
======
I am a four-year Ph.D. student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, supervised by [Prof.Xiang Wan](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/teacher/406) and [Prof.Tsung-Hui Chang](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/changtsunghui/Home). 
Before that, I received a masterâ€™s degree in computer science and technology from Harbin Institute of Technology, supervised by [Prof.Yi Guan](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/guanyi).

Research Interests
======
